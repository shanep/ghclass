# Student Quickstart for Github Classrooms

- Create a Github account if you don’t already have one at
  https://github.com/
- Use the link that your instructor gave you to accept the assignment
  on classroom.github.com
- Important! When you accept the assignment it is critical that you
  select your student email address from the list. If you don’t select
  your student email address your instructor will not be able to grade
  your code. If you can’t find your email in the list, contact your
  instructor ASAP to get the issue resolved.
- Once you have accepted your assignment you can launch VSCode to
  download and start on your assignment.
- After the due date for the assignment passes your instructor will
  grade whatever code you have committed and pushed to your
  repository. You can use the GitHub UI to ensure that what is shown
  is what you want graded.
